This playground book explains the concept of motion picture photography and its most relevant feature, the frame rate, by exploring the human obsession with capturing movement (hence the discobolus contour cover image) and historic developments that led to this technology.  

Interactive scenes allow the user to explore image sequences from an old Egyptian tomb and the 19th century phenakistiscope that paved the way for motion picture photography. First attempts to record real life with photography are explored and finally cinematography is introduced. The user is guided to think about image sequences, time and speed to uncover the correct number of frames per second, so an animation of static images will appear as moving to the human eye. 

The playground book utilises UIKit (UIViewControllers, UICollectionViews, UIViews, etc.) to layout content, display and animate images as well as AVFoundation for playing sounds. A strong focus were .playgroundbook format specific features (PaygroundSupport) such as page annotations, glossary entries, hints and assessment status enumeration. Also the PlaygroundLiveViewMessageHandler and PlaygroundRemoteLiveViewProxyDelegate Protocols were implemented. The introduction’s cutscene page uses HTML5 and JavaScript.
